       I love you so much that you are always on my mind, putting a smile on my face and making my heart skip a beat.
        There are so many ways for me to express my love and I plan on showing you just how much love
        I have for you for the rest of my life.
       I hope that my actions let you know the extent of my affection, adoration, and commitment to you."</i> </p>
